Introduction:
    1)The 'hello_fit.sh', 'fitjob.head', 'fitjob.tail' are a set, which used to generate jobs. 
        or
      The 'hello_fit.sh', 'Ds_fitjob.head', 'Ds_fitjob.tail' are a set, which used to generate jobs.
   
   
    2)The 'sub_sh.head' and 'sub_fit.sh' are a set, which used to submit jobs to the cluster.
    3)The run_fit.sh is a separate file used to run jobs with a local terminal .

    
    4)The 'hello_weight_fit.sh', 'fitjob.head', 'fitjob.tail' are aslo a set, which used to generate jobs. 
        or
      The 'hello_weight_fit.sh', 'Ds_fitjob.head', 'Ds_fitjob.tail' are also a set, which used to generate jobs.
      
      But it is used for weight job. - - - -  We generate a series of weight-root file, which take as the weight
      when we fit using this variable as the weight factor and details you can find in ../generate_weight/README .

    5) The 're_hello_fit.sh', 're_fitjob.head', ' re_Ds_fitjob.head', and 're_run_fit.sh' are a set, which used 
        to re-run the faild jobs.

    Notice:
       The 'fitjob.head  fitjob.tail'  or  'Ds_fitjob.head  Ds_fitjob.tail' are differnt in 'hello_fit.sh' and  'hello_weight_fit.sh',
       you should change the contents for *head and *tail.

How to use it ?
To execute this shell code, you just need to enter :
    ./hello_fit.sh jobname  [jobN] [fileN]   or  ./hello_weihgt_fit.sh jobname  [jobN] [fileN]
    such as  ./hello_fit.sh data 30 50   or   ./hello_fit.sh data 30 1 

    (1) When you enter 3 parameters, the second parameter does not work (but i recommend you do it). 
    When this code is executed, it will generate a series of C++ jobs (i do not know how many [jobN]) and each c++ file contains 50 root files (or less). 

    (2) This code is used  to generate new root file.
        By executing this code, it will extract information from the existing root file and save the result as a new root file.
    (3) It will generate a series of directories, for example, 
        ../output/fit/mode_0, ../output/fit/mode_1 , ../output/fit/mode_2, ../output/fit/mode_50, and ../output/root. 

    Under the ../output/fit/mode_i directory, it includes subdirectories (energ points) such as 4610, 4620 and so on.
        ../output/root/mode_0/4610    
        ../output/root/mode_1/4610  and so on


    To submit these works, you just enter:
       ./sub_fit.sh jobname
    such as   ./sub_fit.sh data  (submit jobs to the cluster)
       or 
      ./run_fit.sh jobname (use your local terminal)
