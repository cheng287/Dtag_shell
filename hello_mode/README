Introduction:
    1)The 'hello_mode.sh', 'infor_mode.head', 'infor_mode.tail' are a set, which used to generate jobs.
    2)The 'sub_sh.head' and 'sub_make_hello_mode.sh' are a set, which used to submit jobs to the cluster.
    3)The run_mode.sh is a separate file used to run jobs with a local terminal .

How to use it ?
To execute this shell code, you just need to enter :
    ./hello_mode.sh jobname  [jobN] [fileN]
    such as  ./hello_mode.sh data 30 50   or   ./hello_mode.sh data 30 1 

    (1) When you enter 3 parameters, the second parameter does not work (but i recommend you do it). 
        When this code is executed, it will generate a series of C++ jobs (i do not know how many [jobN]) and each c++ file contains 50 root files (or less). 

    (2) This code is used  to generate new root file.
        By executing this code, it will extract information from the existing root file and save the result as a new root file.
    (3) It will generate a series of directories, for example, 
            ../output/mode_0, ../output/mode_1 , ../output/mode_2, ../output/mode_50, and ../output/root. 

        Under the ../output/root directory, it includes subdirectories such as mode_0, mode_1, mode_50 and so on.
            ../output/root/mode_0    ../output/root/mode_1  and so on


To submit these works, you just enter:
    ./sub_mode.sh jobname
 such as   ./sub_mode.sh data  (submit jobs to the cluster)
    or 
   ./run_mode.sh jobname (use your local terminal)
